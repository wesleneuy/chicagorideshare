Ridehailing services have significantly changed the transportation landscape since they were introduced over a decade ago. The popularity of these services has several implications, from increased congestion to competing with other modes. In April 2019, Chicago became the first US city to release [data] [data] on ridehailing services including Uber, Lyft, and Via. The TNC data supplements previously released datasets on taxi trips and Divvy bikeshare. The goal is to better understand the effects of transportation network company (TNC) trips on the transportation system, and ultimately, help inform policy and investment decisions. 

The City of Chicago makes the data related to vehicles, drivers, and trips available. The data is anonymous, with trip origins and destinations aggregated at the census tract level, trip times rounded to the nearest 15 minutes and fares rounded to the nearest $2.50. For this project, I seek to answer the following questions: When is demand highest? Where do people travel to and from? What factors influence rideshare demand? I will only use the trips dataset and will only analyze trip patterns for October 2021. More than 5 million trips were taken during this month.
